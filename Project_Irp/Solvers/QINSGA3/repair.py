"""Post-decode 2-opt route repair for QI-NSGA-III (remedy G) -- see
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-04-qinsga3-route-repair-design.md.

Baldwinian repair: improves the FITNESS assigned to a decoded route_result,
never re-encoded back into the chromosome (theta/X) -- the visit order a
2-opt swap produces has no defined inverse into priority genes. Scoped
entirely to QINSGA3: Solvers/NSGA3/decoder.py, evaluator.py, and problem.py
(shared with NSGA3) are never imported for modification here, only their
pure functions (decode_chromosome, build_routes, compute_f1) are reused
unchanged, from Solvers/QINSGA3/algorithm.py's _evaluate_with_repair.
